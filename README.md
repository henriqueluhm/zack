# zack

**zack** is a terminal-based text editor written in Rust, built with [Ropey](https://github.com/cessen/ropey), [Crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm), and [Ratatui](https://github.com/tui-rs/ratatui).  
It is an early-stage experimental project focused on core editing functionality such as buffer manipulation, cursor movement, and basic input handling.

## Features (WIP)

- Text buffer using `ropey`
- Basic Vim-style motions (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`)
- Minimal UI with `ratatui`
- File opening and saving 

## Build & Run
